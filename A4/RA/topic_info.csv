One of the goals for analyzing such data is hence to extract such\n'shift-invariant' atoms. Even though some success has been reported with\nexisting algorithms, they are limited in applicability due to their heuristic\nnature. Moreover, they are often vulnerable to artifacts and impulsive noise,\nwhich are typically present in raw neural recordings. In this study, we address\nthese issues and propose a novel probabilistic convolutional sparse coding\n(CSC) model for learning shift-invariant atoms from raw neural signals\ncontaining potentially severe artifacts. In the core of our model, which we\ncall $\\alpha$CSC, lies a family of heavy-tailed distributions called\n$\\alpha$-stable distributions. We develop a novel, computationally efficient\nMonte Carlo expectation-maximization algorithm for inference. The maximization\nstep boils down to a weighted CSC problem, for which we develop a\ncomputationally efficient optimization algorithm. Our results show that the\nproposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art convergence speeds. Besides,\n$\\alpha$CSC is significantly more robust to artifacts when compared to three\ncompeting algorithms: it can extract spike bursts, oscillations, and even\nreveal more subtle phenomena such as cross-frequency coupling when applied to\nnoisy neural time series.\n"", 'Algorithms for solving optimization problems arising from deep neural net models: nonsmooth problems   Machine Learning models incorporating multiple layered learning networks have\nbeen seen to provide effective models for various classification problems. The\nresulting optimization problem to solve for the optimal vector minimizing the\nempirical risk is, however, highly nonconvex. This alone presents a challenge\nto application and development of appropriate optimization algorithms for\nsolving the problem. However, in addition, there are a number of interesting\nproblems for which the objective function is non- smooth and nonseparable. In\nthis paper, we summarize the primary challenges involved, the state of the art,\nand present some numerical results on an interesting and representative class\nof problems.\n', 'Speeding-up Object Detection Training for Robotics with FALKON   Latest deep learning methods for object detection provide remarkable\nperformance, but have limits when used in robotic applications. One of the most\nrelevant issues is the long training time, which is due to the large size and\nimbalance of the associated training sets, characterized by few positive and a\nlarge number of negative examples (i.e. background). Proposed approaches are\nbased on end-to-end learning by back-propagation [22] or kernel methods trained\nwith Hard Negatives Mining on top of deep features [8]. These solutions are\neffective, but prohibitively slow for on-line applications. In this paper we\npropose a novel pipeline for object detection that overcomes this problem and\nprovides comparable performance, with a 60x training speedup. Our pipeline\ncombines (i) the Region Proposal Network and the deep feature extractor from\n[22] to efficiently select candidate RoIs and encode them into powerful\nrepresentations, with (ii) the FALKON [23] algorithm, a novel kernel-based\nmethod that allows fast training on large scale problems (millions of points).\nWe address the size and imbalance of training data by exploiting the stochastic\nsubsampling intrinsic into the method and a novel, fast, bootstrapping\napproach. We assess the effectiveness of the approach on a standard Computer\nVision dataset (PASCAL VOC 2007 [5]) and demonstrate its applicability to a\nreal robotic scenario with the iCubWorld Transformations [18] dataset.\n']"

However, this also brings drawbacks when compared to other function\napproximators such as tile coding or their generalisations, radial basis\nfunctions (RBF) because they introduce instability due to the side effect of\nglobalised updates present in neural networks. This instability does not even\nvanish in neural networks that do not have any hidden layers. In this paper, we\nshow that simple modifications to the structure of the neural network can\nimprove stability of DQN learning when a multi-layer perceptron is used for\nfunction approximation.\n', 'Overfitting Mechanism and Avoidance in Deep Neural Networks   Assisted by the availability of data and high performance computing, deep\nlearning techniques have achieved breakthroughs and surpassed human performance\nempirically in difficult tasks, including object recognition, speech\nrecognition, and natural language processing. As they are being used in\ncritical applications, understanding underlying mechanisms for their successes\nand limitations is imperative. In this paper, we show that overfitting, one of\nthe fundamental issues in deep neural networks, is due to continuous gradient\nupdating and scale sensitiveness of cross entropy loss. By separating samples\ninto correctly and incorrectly classified ones, we show that they behave very\ndifferently, where the loss decreases in the correct ones and increases in the\nincorrect ones. Furthermore, by analyzing dynamics during training, we propose\na consensus-based classification algorithm that enables us to avoid overfitting\nand significantly improve the classification accuracy especially when the\nnumber of training samples is limited. As each trained neural network depends\non extrinsic factors such as initial values as well as training data, requiring\nconsensus among multiple models reduces extrinsic factors substantially; for\nstatistically independent models, the reduction is exponential. Compared to\nensemble algorithms, the proposed algorithm avoids overgeneralization by not\nclassifying ambiguous inputs. Systematic experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithm. For example, using only 1000 training\nsamples from MNIST dataset, the proposed algorithm achieves 95% accuracy,\nsignificantly higher than any of the individual models, with 90% of the test\nsamples classified.\n', 'Learning What Data to Learn   Machine learning is essentially the sciences of playing with data. An\nadaptive data selection strategy, enabling to dynamically choose different data\nat various training stages, can reach a more effective model in a more\nefficient way. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning\nframework, which we call \\emph{\\textbf{N}eural \\textbf{D}ata \\textbf{F}ilter}\n(\\textbf{NDF}), to explore automatic and adaptive data selection in the\ntraining process. In particular, NDF takes advantage of a deep neural network\nto adaptively select and filter important data instances from a sequential\nstream of training data, such that the future accumulative reward (e.g., the\nconvergence speed) is maximized. In contrast to previous studies in data\nselection that is mainly based on heuristic strategies, NDF is quite generic\nand thus can be widely suitable for many machine learning tasks. Taking neural\nnetwork training with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as an example,\ncomprehensive experiments with respect to various neural network modeling\n(e.g., multi-layer perceptron networks, convolutional neural networks and\nrecurrent neural networks) and several applications (e.g., image classification\nand text understanding) demonstrate that NDF powered SGD can achieve comparable\naccuracy with standard SGD process by using less data and fewer iterations.\n']"

In particular, we describe a necessary and sufficient condition\nfor decidability of the word problem in LHG. Then, based on the graded\nsmall-cancellation theory of Olshanskii, we develop a general framework which\nallows us to construct lacunary hyperbolic groups with word and conjugacy\nproblems highly controllable and flexible both in terms of computability and\ncomputational complexity.\nAs an application, we show that for any recursively enumerable subset\n$\\mathcal{L} \\subseteq \\mathcal{A}^*$, where $\\mathcal{A}^*$ is the set of\nwords over arbitrarily chosen non-empty finite alphabet $\\mathcal{A}$, there\nexists a lacunary hyperbolic group $G_{\\mathcal{L}}$ such that the membership\nproblem for $ \\mathcal{L}$ is `almost' linear time equivalent to the conjugacy\nproblem in $G_{\\mathcal{L}}$. Moreover, for the mentioned group the word and\nindividual conjugacy problems are decidable in `almost' linear time.\nAnother application is the construction of a lacunary hyperbolic group with\n`almost' linear time word problem and with all the individual conjugacy\nproblems being undecidable except the word problem.\nAs yet another application of the developed framework, we construct infinite\nverbally complete groups and torsion free Tarski monsters, i.e. infinite\ntorsion-free groups all of whose proper subgroups are cyclic, with `almost'\nlinear time word and polynomial time conjugacy problems. These groups are\nconstructed as quotients of arbitrarily given non-elementary torsion-free\nhyperbolic groups and are lacunary hyperbolic.\nFinally, as a consequence of the main results, we answer a few open\nquestions.\n"", 'Lower bounds for the index of compact constant mean curvature surfaces in $\\mathbb R^{3}$ and $\\mathbb S^{3}$   Let $M$ be a compact constant mean curvature surface either in $\\mathbb{S}^3$\nor $\\mathbb{R}^3$. In this paper we prove that the stability index of $M$ is\nbounded below by a linear function of the genus. As a by product we obtain a\ncomparison theorem between the spectrum of the Jacobi operator of $M$ and those\nof Hodge Laplacian of $1$-forms on $M$.\n', 'The cohomology of free loop spaces of homogeneous spaces   The free loops space $\\Lambda X$ of a space $X$ has become an important\nobject of study particularly in the case when $X$ is a manifold.The study of\nfree loop spaces is motivated in particular by two main examples. The first is\ntheir relation to geometrically distinct periodic geodesics on a manifold,\noriginally studied by Gromoll and Meyer in $1969$. More recently the study of\nstring topology and in particular the Chas-Sullivan loop product has been an\nactive area of research.\nA complete flag manifold is the quotient of a Lie group by its maximal torus\nand is one of the nicer examples of a homogeneous space. Both the cohomology\nand Chas-Sullivan product structure are understood for spaces $S^n$,\n$\\mathbb{C}P^n$ and most simple Lie groups. Hence studying the topology of the\nfree loops space on homogeneous space is a natural next step.\nIn the thesis we compute the differentials in the integral Leray-Serre\nspectral sequence associated to the free loops space fibrations in the cases of\n$SU(n+1)/T^n$ and $Sp(n)/T^n$.

We\nassume that these modulations have the character of two-dimensional spin-vortex\ncheckerboard and investigate whether this assumption is consistent with the\nFermi surface and the pseudogap measured by angle-resolved photo-emission\nspectroscopy. We also explore the possibility of observing quantum oscillations\nof transport coefficients in such a background. These investigations are based\non a model of non-interacting spin-1/2 fermions hopping on a square lattice and\ncoupled through spins to a magnetic field imitating spin-vortex checkerboard.\nThe main results of this article include (i) calculation of Fermi surface\ncontaining Fermi arcs at the positions in the Brillouin zone largely consistent\nwith experiments; (ii) identification of factors complicating the observations\nof quantum oscillations in the presence of spin modulations; and (iii)\ninvestigation of the symmetries of the resulting electronic energy bands,\nwhich, in particular, indicates that each band is double-degenerate and, in\naddition, has at least one conical point, where it touches another\ndouble-degenerate band.

The specific-heat\nmeasurements show a magnetic transition at 16 K which is also confirmed by\nmagnetic susceptibility, ESR, and neutron diffraction measurements. Magnetic\nentropy deduced from the specific heat corresponds to a two-level degree of\nfreedom per Mo$^{5+}$ ion, and the effective moment from the susceptibility\ncorresponds to the spin-only value. Using {\\it ab initio} quantum chemistry\ncalculations we demonstrate that the Mo$^{5+}$ ion hosts a purely spin-$1/2$\nmagnetic moment, indicating negligible effects of spin-orbit interaction. The\nquenched orbital moments originate from the large displacement of Mo ions\ninside the MoO$_6$ octahedra along the apical direction. The ground state is\nshown by neutron diffraction to support a collinear Néel-type magnetic order,\nand a spin-flop transition is observed around an applied magnetic field of 3.5\nT.

This large-cat sized, 5.1 robot is one of a kind of a recent,\nbioinspired legged robot class designed with the capability of model-free\nlocomotion control. Animal legged locomotion in rough terrain is clearly shaped\nby sensor feedback systems.

[...]\n"", 'Bipedal Walking with Corrective Actions in the Tilt Phase Space   Many methods exist for a bipedal robot to keep its balance while walking. In\naddition to step size and timing, other strategies are possible that influence\nthe stability of the robot without interfering with the target direction and\nspeed of locomotion. This paper introduces a multifaceted feedback controller\nthat uses numerous different feedback mechanisms, collectively termed\ncorrective actions, to stabilise a core keypoint-based gait. The feedback\ncontroller is experimentally effective, yet free of any physical model of the\nrobot, very computationally inexpensive, and requires only a single 6-axis IMU\nsensor. Due to these low requirements, the approach is deemed to be highly\nportable between robots, and was specifically also designed to target lower\ncost robots that have suboptimal sensing, actuation and computational\nresources. The IMU data is used to estimate the yaw-independent tilt\norientation of the robot, expressed in the so-called tilt phase space, and is\nthe source of all feedback provided by the controller. Experimental validation\nis performed in simulation as well as on real robot hardware.\n']"

The cell-based H2O2 generation is affected\nby the medium volume, the cell confluence, as well as the discharge voltage.\nThe application of cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) in the cancer treatment has\nbeen intensively investigated over the past decade. Several cellular responses\nto the CAP treatment have been observed including the consumption of the\nCAP-originated reactive species, the rise of intracellular reactive oxygen\nspecies, the damage on DNA and mitochondria, as well as the activation of\napoptotic events.

In this study we highlight\nthe importance of modeling tanks, which can limit the charge/discharge capacity\nof redox-active polymer (RAP) based RFBs. The losses due to tank mixing\ndominate over the polarization-induced capacity losses that arise due to\nresistive processes in the reactor. A porous electrode model is used to\nseparate these effects by predicting the time variation of active species\nconcentration in electrodes and tanks. A simple transient model based on\nspecies conservation laws developed in this study reveals that charge\nutilization and polarization are affected by two dimensionless numbers\nquantifying (1) flow rate relative to stoichiometric flow and (2) size of flow\nbattery tanks relative to the reactor. The RFB's utilization is shown to\nincrease monotonically with flow rate, reaching 90% of the theoretical value\nonly when flow rate exceeds twenty-fold of the stoichiometric value. We also\nidentify polarization due to irreversibilities inherent to RFB architecture as\na result of tank mixing and current distribution internal to the reactor, and\nthis polarization dominates over that resulting from ohmic resistances\nparticularly when cycling RFBs at low flow rates and currents.
